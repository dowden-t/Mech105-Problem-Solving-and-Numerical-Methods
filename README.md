# _Mech105-Problem-Solving-and-Numerical-Methods_
⋅⋅⋅This repository contains all of the algorithms I created over the Spring 2021 semester in Dr. Bechara's Mech 105 class. 

The algorithms contained include a couple of solutions to specific problems, a converter from base 10 to binary, and a couple of algorthims to solve various numerical methods.
