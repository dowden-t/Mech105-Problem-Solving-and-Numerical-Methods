#Simple Electrical Circuit

This algorithm calculates the charge on a capacitor in the circuit shown below. It is specifically designed to calculate t from 0 to 0.8 but only when q0=10, R=60, L=9, and C=0.00005.

It also plots this function, as well as a function where the capacitance is ten times larger, and shows the two graphs side by side.
